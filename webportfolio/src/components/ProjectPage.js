          <p className="ml-2">A simple neural network built in Python using TensorFlow and Keras to solve the XOR logic gate ‚Äî a foundational non-linear problem in machine learning. The model features one hidden layer (8 neurons, tanh activation) and a sigmoid output layer, trained with binary cross-entropy and the Adam optimizer. After 5000 epochs, it successfully learned XOR outputs. This project was a hands-on intro to neural network architecture and training fundamentals.</p>
